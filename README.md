# Analyzing-Wavecon-Telecom-5G-Launch
Iâ€™m excited to share the key takeaways from my analysis of Wavecon's 5G launch during my virtual internship! This project allowed me to explore Wavecon's dashboard data and address crucial business questions through data-driven insights.

About Wavecon: Wavecon, a leading telecom provider in India, introduced 5G services in May 2022 across major cities, in line with other telecom providers. This analysis assesses the impact of Wavecon's 5G rollout across 15 key urban centers, focusing on its effects on revenue, plan performance, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Key Insights: ðŸ’¸ Revenue Impact: The 5G launch caused a slight revenue decrease, moving from $16B to $15.9B.

ðŸ“‰ User Engagement: A decline in active users (AU) and an increase in unsubscribed users (TUSU) suggest potential challenges in user retention and engagement.

ðŸ“Š Plan Performance: While certain plans thrived post-5G launch, contributing to strong revenue, others saw a downturn, indicating areas needing further attention and optimization.

ðŸŒŸ Top Performers: Plans 1, 11, and 12 emerged as the top-performing plans during this period.

ðŸš« Phased-Out Plans: Plans P8, P9, and P10 were discontinued after the 5G launch due to low demand and overlap in the product lineup.

ðŸ“ˆ Total Unsubscribed Users (TUSU): With the exception of Mumbai (-12.36%), all cities experienced an increase in TUSU, with Lucknow, Pune, and Jaipur showing significant growth (over 50%).

These insights will help Wavecon refine its strategies and optimize for future growth. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
